About the game
--------------

Lately I've noticed that almost everyone I meet with a smartphone is playing the game '4 Pics 1 Word', a kind of puzzle game in which four pictures are displayed and the player has to guess what those pictures represent as a word. There are some given blank spaces and a string of alphabets to get started. So given those resources one has to come up with the correct answer.

Motivation
----------

Not blowing my own horn but I'm above average in it I suppose. Implied from the fact that friends Whatsapp me when stuck :D So in order to end the risks of someone out there gettting stuck at one level with utter frustration, I thought of coming up with a solution. Thus this mini side project. A nights worth of work.

The solution
-------------

This is a Python3 implementation to solve the popular game '4 pics 1 word'. It's all bare bones at the moment. I will be refactoring/optimizing it later(hopefully).
Just enter the length of the empty space of the answer and then enter the character clues given. It will result in a narrowed down bunch of possible words. Making the players job a little easier ;)
